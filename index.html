							<p>And this is our project, <strong>Project Title</strong>.
								A data exploration journey where we delve into women’s perception of HIV. Armed with laptops(+coffee:>) and curiosity, 
								we aim to uncover how education shapes attitudes towards HIV among women. While we’re just students with data in hand, 
								we hope to stimulate discussions and contribute to the development of targeted programs and educational campaigns aimed 
								at addressing HIV among women.

                                				<p>Our dataset is a subset of the 2022 Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). This nationwide survey 
									features a nationally representative sample of approximately 35,000 households from 34,232 housing units. 
									Our focus is on basic demographic indicators, health status, and knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS.

								<!-- <p>With the help of Python, we were able to process our dataset to retain only the needed data.</p> -->
								<p>The sampling scheme provides data representative of the country as a whole, for urban and rural areas separately, and for each of the country’s 
									administrative regions. The first stage involved a systematic selection of 1,247 primary sampling units (PSUs) distributed by province or HUC. 
									A PSU can be a barangay, a portion of a large barangay, or two or more adjacent small barangays. In the second stage, an equal take of either 
									22 or 29 sample housing units were selected from each sampled PSU using systematic random sampling.

								<p> We loaded the data, renamed columns for clarity, and addressed missing values by replacing empty entries with NaN and 
									removing incomplete data. Irrelevant columns were removed, and all data types were standardized to integers where possible. 
									The dataset was then split into meaningful sub-components, cleaned further, and recombined. This ensured a streamlined and 
									accurate dataset ready for analysis.

							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Preprocessing</h3>
								<p>We selected 17 relevant survey questions to determine respondents' perceptions towards HIV and other STIs. 
									These questions were exclusively posed to individuals who indicated awareness of STIs and AIDS.
									We applied various preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, standardizing numerical features, 
									and encoding categorical variables to ensure that our data was clean and ready for analysis.

						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style3">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Visualization</h3>
								<p>We used Plotly to create interactive pie charts for each survey question. 
									These visualizations allowed us to understand the distribution of responses (Yes, No, Don't Know) for each question.
									We configured subplot layouts to neatly display the pie charts, making it easier to compare the response 
									distributions across all questions.

						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Quantification</h3>
								<p>We calculated the "Perception Mean" by taking the average response across all relevant survey questions for each respondent. 
									This provided a single metric to represent overall perception.
									We displayed the numerical description of the Perception Mean to understand its distribution.
								</p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Group Analysis</h3>

						<h3>Visualization for Modeling</h3>
						<p>We used Plotly to create interactive plots that helped us visualize relationships within the data. 
							These visualizations not only helped in exploration but also set the stage for more sophisticated modeling. 
							By understanding the distribution of perception scores, we prepared the data for potential predictive modeling tasks.

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pm_boxplot.png" alt="Perception Mean Box Plot" /></a>
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Box Plot</h3>
								<p>We created a box plot to visualize the distribution of the Perception Mean by different educational levels. 
									This helped in identifying any outliers and understanding the central trend and spread of the perception 
									scores among the different education groups.

								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Normal Distribution</h3>
								<p>We generated scatter plots overlaid with normal distribution curves to visualize the distribution of the 
									Perception Mean for each educational level group. This provided insights into the shape and spread of the 
									data and how perception is distributed across different educational backgrounds.

								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Nutshell Graph</h3>
								<p>The nutshell graph illustrates the mean perception of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among different 
									age groups, separated by their highest educational attainment, based on data from the 2022 Philippines 
									National Demographic and Health Survey. The y-axis represents the average perception level (ranging from 0.0 to 0.8), 
									while the x-axis categorizes the respondents into age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49 years old.
									<br>
									<br>
									The bars are color-coded to indicate the educational levels: blue for primary, purple for secondary, and pink for 
									higher education. Across all age groups, individuals with higher education exhibit the highest perception mean, 
									indicating a better understanding or awareness of STIs. Specifically, those with higher education consistently score 
									higher than 0.6. In contrast, individuals with primary education have the lowest perception means, typically 
									around 0.50 to 0.55, while those with secondary education fall in between, generally ranging from 0.55 to 0.6.
									<br>
									<br>
									The data suggests a strong correlation between educational attainment and STI awareness, with higher education 
									leading to greater awareness. This trend is consistent across all age groups, though there is minimal deviation 
									within each educational category among different age groups. Overall, the graph highlights the vital role of 
									education in enhancing STI awareness.

						<h3>Linear Regression Model</h3>
						<p>We used scikit-learn’s Linear Regression model to understand the relationship between our target, "Perception Mean," 
							and severalfeatures: "Respondent's current age," "Age in 5-year groups," "Highest educational level," and "Highest year of education."
						</p>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Training and Testing</h3>

									The LinearRegression object was instantiated and trained using the fit method on the training data.

						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Evaluation Metrics</h3>
								<p>Our regression models were assessed using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics indicate the model’s performance, 
									where lower values of MSE imply better accuracy, and R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable 
									explained by the independent variables.
								</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style2">
								<h3 class="mb-5 text-2xl font-bold">Feature Analysis</h3>

									each feature and calculating their coefficients along with the corresponding MSE, and R-squared values.
